"The Pisi Linux Project.Pisi Linux is a fork of the (PiSi-based) Pardus "
"operating system and its unique core components. When it became apparent "
"early in 2012 that Pardus was to be abandoned for political/financial "
"reasons, a small group of Turkish volunteers came together to preserve the "
"unique features of Pardus which might otherwise have been lost. The name of "
"this project is Anka (Turkish for Phoenix). Initially the Anka-Team believed "
"that the fork could be named Pardus-Anka. Ultimately, this was not possible, "
"hence re-branding to Pisi Linux as a reference to Pardus and its package "
"system PiSi. (Pisi is Turkish for kitty and Pardus is an Anatolian leopard). "
"Aside from technical innovation, Pardus had a reputation for stability and "
"ease of use. The aim of the Anka-Team therefore, in maintaining and "
"promoting original Pardus technologies is to provide a unique, technically "
